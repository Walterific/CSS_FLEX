# CSS_FLEX
This example demonstrates the structure and styling of a webpage that includes an employee card layout. The HTML consists of a navigation bar and a section with multiple employee cards. Each card displays employee data, such as the job title, net worth, and an image. A "View Profile" button is provided for interaction.

Here are some key components:

Header and Navbar:
A navigation bar at the top allows users to switch between different pages (e.g., Employee Cards, Product Layout, etc.).

Employee Cards:
Each employee card contains an image, a job title, net worth, and a button to view the employee's profile. The cards are styled to be responsive, adjusting their layout on smaller screens.
The CSS makes use of flexible layouts (flex-wrap, justify-content, etc.), ensuring that the cards are arranged neatly in different screen sizes. Hover effects (box-shadow, color changes) enhance interactivity.

This structure can be applied to other pages like Product Layout, Student Profile, Movie List, and MLBB Heroes using a similar pattern, as seen in the CSS classes.
